I actually plan to study and do engineering in the future, so I wanted to visit EPFL and see what an elite engineering school looks like.\nThe organisers of the ctfs, polyglots planned a short tour around the EPFL campus (which was huge), which involved touring around the SPOT, and the EPFL Data Centre.\nThe SPOT The SPOT (Student Prototyping and Outreach Tank) is EPFL’s Makerspace, and it is actually one of the coolest places I’ve ever seen.\nIt’s filled with really high tech machines used for making electronics, hardware, pcbs, printing, and pretty much anything you need to make anything you want. A lot of students were working on their projects there, ranging from bikes to rockets to rovers and it was super cool seeing them work. The environment just makes you feel inspired and innovative and kinda motivates you to work on your own projects there.\nEPFL Data Centre This is actually the first data centre I’ve ever visited, so that was cool. But it’s really just a data centre, so the insides are just filled with servers, and well, even more servers. (I mean, what did you expect?)\nBut the cool thing about this data centre is how environmental friendly it was, since it was covered with solar panels, and they actually redirect the heat produced by the servers to heat up the water that is pumped from the lake!\nPizza Party There was a pizza party after the tour, and they prepared club-mates!\nI remember hearing about club-mates in a LiveOverflow video before, and he said that it was associated with like german hacker culture or smthg, so it was really cool seeing one in real life!\nWe also got our lenyards and free shirts.\nThe CTF We managed to get 4th!
